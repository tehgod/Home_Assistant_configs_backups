# Home Assistant Configuration Files Backup

This repository contains a backup of my Home Assistant configuration files. These files are used to customize the behavior and appearance of my Home Assistant instance, including device integrations, automation rules, and Lovelace UI dashboards.
## Usage

To use these configuration files, you will need to have a Home Assistant instance set up on your system. You can then clone this repository to your local machine and copy the contents to your Home Assistant configuration directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/home-assistant-config.git
cp -r home-assistant-config/* /path/to/your/home-assistant-config/

```

Note that you will need to modify the configuration.yaml file to match your specific Home Assistant setup. You may also need to install additional dependencies or integrations depending on the devices and services you are using.
